            "Gender equality depends on democratic and gender-sensitive governance. However, the participation of women and men in formal and informal decision-making structures varies greatly between countries, and is usually in favor of men. Institutional as well as cultural, economic and societal factors limit women\u2019s opportunities and abilities to participate in decision making. Gender governance is about attempts to change gender regimes by inserting new policies, procedures, and values through global and multilevel governance. It studies, for example, the representation of women in electoral bodies and parties, theorizes representation in political bodies, and looks at the organization of welfare politics. The Panel Discussion on Gender Concerns in Governance is an effort by the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Graphic Era (Deemed to be) University, Dehradun to discuss and debate current policy issues in a variety of contexts and locations. The speakers address issues such as Gender-responsive Budget and Women\u2019s formal participation and representation in the structures of governance. \nThe Panelists of the day are: \n\nSession 1: Gender Responsive Budget\nProf. Lekha Chakraborty\nProf. Vibhuti N Patel\nProf. Raj Dhar\n\nSession 2: Women Participation and Representation in Formal Structures of Governance\nMs. Mira Iyer\nMs. Debajanee Bora\nDr. Rukmani"

A total of 236 Units of Blood was donated, which is another record for blood donation during the pandemic.\n \nWe have a long and glorious history of contributing the highest in blood donation drives, and we hold our heads high for that. Graphic Era promises to keep on this track and work relentlessly to contribute to this noble cause for countless years to come! Be a proud blood donor!\n \nCongratulations to all the donors, you are all heroes!"

            "A great poet is the truest interpreter of his time and day. He fears none and is driven by the urge to find the beauty in even the cruelest of places. Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason, and brings immense light and happiness in the world. \n\nOne such legendary poet is the late Shri Om Vyas Ji. He is a renowned figure amongst the greatest poets of the nation. Celebrated for his #HasyaPoems, his unique oration, and entertaining style of presentation, Graphic Era shares his last performance before his painful demise in 2009, at the University\u2019s Akhil Bhartiya Kavi Sammelan held in the year 2008. We are grateful to have witnessed the marvelous artistry and charm he displays on stage with utmost \u00e9lan and poise. We feel blessed to have shared the same space with him. We will miss his heart-touching poetry and his awe-inspiring performances. \n\nWe hope you enjoy these moments of bliss and joy.\n\nHappy Mother's Day!\n#mothersday"
