AfdgbS087ec,National Panel Discussion on Gender Concerns in Governance || Graphic Era University,"Gender equality depends on democratic and gender-sensitive governance. However, the participation of women and men in formal and informal decision-making structures varies greatly between countries, and is usually in favor of men. Institutional as well as cultural, economic and societal factors limit women‚Äôs opportunities and abilities to participate in decision making. Gender governance is about attempts to change gender regimes by inserting new policies, procedures, and values through global and multilevel governance. It studies, for example, the representation of women in electoral bodies and parties, theorizes representation in political bodies, and looks at the organization of welfare politics. The Panel Discussion on Gender Concerns in Governance is an effort by the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Graphic Era (Deemed to be) University, Dehradun to discuss and debate current policy issues in a variety of contexts and locations. The speakers address issues such as Gender-responsive Budget and Women‚Äôs formal participation and representation in the structures of governance. 
The Panelists of the day are: 

Session 1: Gender Responsive Budget
Prof. Lekha Chakraborty
Prof. Vibhuti N Patel
Prof. Raj Dhar

Session 2: Women Participation and Representation in Formal Structures of Governance

A Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure that are used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays. They allow binary search for fast lookup, addition and removal of data items, and can be used to implement dynamic sets and lookup tables. They are an essential concept under Data Structures and Algorithms.

Unlike linear data structures like #Array, #LinkedList, #Queue, and #Stack, which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways as explained in the video above.

IPah0V39tZE,Kavi Om Vyas Ji | ‚ÄúMAA‚Äù Kavita | Akhil Bharatiya Kavi Sammelan  - 2008 | Graphic Era University,"A great poet is the truest interpreter of his time and day. He fears none and is driven by the urge to find the beauty in even the cruelest of places. Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason, and brings immense light and happiness in the world. 

One such legendary poet is the late Shri Om Vyas Ji. He is a renowned figure amongst the greatest poets of the nation. Celebrated for his #HasyaPoems, his unique oration, and entertaining style of presentation, Graphic Era shares his last performance before his painful demise in 2009, at the University‚Äôs Akhil Bhartiya Kavi Sammelan held in the year 2008. We are grateful to have witnessed the marvelous artistry and charm he displays on stage with utmost √©lan and poise. We feel blessed to have shared the same space with him. We will miss his heart-touching poetry and his awe-inspiring performances. 

We hope you enjoy these moments of bliss and joy.

Happy Mother's Day!

An event that provides students a platform to showcase their skills and talents and prove their proficiency in a plethora of cultural and technical competitions.

GraFest is a cultural extravaganza organized FOR and BY the students of their university, who bring their wildest dreams to life with utmost flair and finesse!

The music concerts by world-renowned celebrities are undisputedly the highlight of the 3-day fest. 2019 witnessed the performances of versatile stars like Neeti Mohan, bringing in the most vivacious blast of energy to the audience, Hardy Sandhu, sweeping the crowd off of their feet with his charm and jive, and the alpha of EDM ‚Äì Don Diablo making his audience zealously lose their inhibitions and passionately dance to his beats!

AfdgbS087ec,National Panel Discussion on Gender Concerns in Governance || Graphic Era University,"Gender equality depends on democratic and gender-sensitive governance. However, the participation of women and men in formal and informal decision-making structures varies greatly between countries, and is usually in favor of men. Institutional as well as cultural, economic and societal factors limit women‚Äôs opportunities and abilities to participate in decision making. Gender governance is about attempts to change gender regimes by inserting new policies, procedures, and values through global and multilevel governance. It studies, for example, the representation of women in electoral bodies and parties, theorizes representation in political bodies, and looks at the organization of welfare politics. The Panel Discussion on Gender Concerns in Governance is an effort by the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Graphic Era (Deemed to be) University, Dehradun to discuss and debate current policy issues in a variety of contexts and locations. The speakers address issues such as Gender-responsive Budget and Women‚Äôs formal participation and representation in the structures of governance. 
The Panelists of the day are: 

Session 1: Gender Responsive Budget
Prof. Lekha Chakraborty
Prof. Vibhuti N Patel
Prof. Raj Dhar

Session 2: Women Participation and Representation in Formal Structures of Governance

Unlike linear data structures like #Array, #LinkedList, #Queue, and #Stack, which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways as explained in the video above.

ZQmdXyK62y4,Djikstra Algorithm vs Bellman Ford Algorithm|Comparison|Prof. Kamal Ghanshala|Graphic Era University,"Finding the #shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph is one of the most crucial and popular questions asked across the globe. 

However, amongst the many algorithms that can be utilized to find the shortest route, we will now compare two important approaches - The #Dijkstra's Algorithm, and the #Bellman-Ford Algorithm. Let's understand the differences between the two algorithms, and the conditions in which each can most optimally be applied.

We must know the story of those products. We must know if the product brings happiness and quality into the lives of its makers. 

We feel immensely proud to announce that the Department of Fashion Designing, Graphic Era Hill University, has taken the initiative of meeting the shortage of protective face masks amongst those at the frontline of the COVID-19 Global Epidemic.

The department has created a Double-Layered, washable, and reusable Khadi fabric mask that provides adequate protection to the Corona Warriors, also indirectly provides livelihood and sustenance to handloom weavers, and lastly acts as an income generation opportunity for unemployed women with the skill of sewing. 

The mask has been patterned, cut, sewn, and sterilized by the department of Fashion Design, GEHU, and has been disinfected and packaged under UV light in a Laminar Airflow Chamber from the Department of Pharma. The masks have been handed over to the Police Department of Uttarakhand.  

With hope, faith, love, and compassion, the ANY epidemic can be defeated. Let's all join hands to create a healthy, corona-free world.",Wooow nice video watching you from Dubai,2020-05-12T06:32:51Z,Bridget Babe,0,1,3,0,66,850,9800

IPah0V39tZE,Kavi Om Vyas Ji | ‚ÄúMAA‚Äù Kavita | Akhil Bharatiya Kavi Sammelan  - 2008 | Graphic Era University,"A great poet is the truest interpreter of his time and day. He fears none and is driven by the urge to find the beauty in even the cruelest of places. Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason, and brings immense light and happiness in the world. 

One such legendary poet is the late Shri Om Vyas Ji. He is a renowned figure amongst the greatest poets of the nation. Celebrated for his #HasyaPoems, his unique oration, and entertaining style of presentation, Graphic Era shares his last performance before his painful demise in 2009, at the University‚Äôs Akhil Bhartiya Kavi Sammelan held in the year 2008. We are grateful to have witnessed the marvelous artistry and charm he displays on stage with utmost √©lan and poise. We feel blessed to have shared the same space with him. We will miss his heart-touching poetry and his awe-inspiring performances. 

We hope you enjoy these moments of bliss and joy.

Happy Mother's Day!

iM0e9XOHEhU,"Grafest - Throwback | A glance at India‚Äôs biggest University Fest | Graphic Era University, Dehradun","Here‚Äôs a throwback to the most cherished days in the lives of our Graphians!  

An event that provides students a platform to showcase their skills and talents and prove their proficiency in a plethora of cultural and technical competitions.

GraFest is a cultural extravaganza organized FOR and BY the students of their university, who bring their wildest dreams to life with utmost flair and finesse!

The music concerts by world-renowned celebrities are undisputedly the highlight of the 3-day fest. 2019 witnessed the performances of versatile stars like Neeti Mohan, bringing in the most vivacious blast of energy to the audience, Hardy Sandhu, sweeping the crowd off of their feet with his charm and jive, and the alpha of EDM ‚Äì Don Diablo making his audience zealously lose their inhibitions and passionately dance to his beats!

This video reminds us of the fun we have had and the joy that‚Äôs lined up for us, yet to come. Re-live those moments and re-energize yourselves!","‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§Ö‡§π‡§∏‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å
